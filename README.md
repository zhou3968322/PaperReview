# Review
- review and critical thinking.
- the final goal is:
- - to think critically about why and how when read code or paper.
- - For a new problem, how to design a better algorithm in a specific hardware environment. 

note:use youdao note.

## PaperReview

### Hardware design 

#### Hardware design for elementary functions

- [High-Speed Function Approximation Using a Minimax Quadratic Interpolator](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1388195)
- - [View ReadMe](./PaperReview/hardware-design/High-Speed%20Function%20Approximation%20Using%20a%20Minimax%20Quadratic%20Interpolator/README.md)
- - 使用minimax approximation 在hardware上实现high-speed的初等函数
- - 例如sin(x), cos(x), e^x 等等.
